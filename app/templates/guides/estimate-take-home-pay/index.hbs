<h1>Why You Should Estimate Your Take-Home Pay, <i>especially</i> before your first paycheck</h1>
<hr>

<p>
  Gearing up for your first job raises a bunch of important questions.<br>

  <ul>
    <li>How much money can I spend once I start working?</li>
    <li>What can I budget for?</li>
    <li>How much should I save a year? From each paycheck?</li>
    <li>What amount of rent can I afford?</li>
    <li>How much will I have to pay in taxes?</li>
  </ul><br>

  All of these uncertainties relate to your take-home pay, a.k.a. the dollar amount that actually hits your bank account or is written on your paychecks. You may be expecting a $40,000 salary, but you definitely won't have $40,000 to spend or save.<br><br>

  This step-by-step guide will help you answer all of these questions, estimate your take-home pay and teach you some valuable personal finance concepts along the way.
