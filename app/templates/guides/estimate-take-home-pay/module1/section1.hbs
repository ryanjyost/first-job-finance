<h3>What It Is</h3>

<p>
  Gross income is how much money you make. Gross <i>annual</i> income is specifically how much you make in a year.<br>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>If you're paid a salary,</strong> then your gross annual income is your salary.</li>
    <li><strong>If you're paid hourly,</strong> then your gross annual income equals how much you make an hour, times the number of hours you work in the week, times how many weeks you work in the year.</li>
  </ul>

  <hr>
    The term <i>gross</i> means "pre-tax" or "before taxes".

<h3>Why It Matters</h3>

<p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can't estimate your take-home pay without knowing your gross income.</li>
    <li>Your gross annual income will largely determine your tax bill. When talked about in the context of taxes, gross annual income refers to how much you make from January 1 to December 31. Otherwise, it just means how much you make in any 365-day period</li>
    <li>When it comes to saving for retirement, the amount you save is usually expressed as a percentage of gross annual income. So when you hear "I'm contributing 5% to my 401k," think "contributing 5% of gross annual income."  </li>
    <li>It's a technical term you'll see throughout your life, so best to understand it <i>when</i> it comes up.</li>
  </ul>

<h6><i>Technically, gross income includes not just the money you earn from your job, but also investment gains/income and a slew of other receipts of money. But since you're young, you probably only have income related to your work. Investment earnings should be going toward savings anyway!</i></h6>
